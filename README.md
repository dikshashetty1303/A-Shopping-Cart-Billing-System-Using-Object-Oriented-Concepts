# A-Shopping-Cart-Billing-System-Using-Object-Oriented-Concepts
 Build a shopping system that allows customers to:   - View available products   - Add items to their cart   - Get a final printed bill
Abstraction – Used abstract Item class with pure virtual functions.
2. Encapsulation – Data (like name and price) is kept private inside classes.
3. Inheritance – Product inherits from Item class.
4. Polymorphism – Virtual functions allow different behavior for different item types.
5. Modularity – Classes like Product and ShoppingCart separate logic neatly.
